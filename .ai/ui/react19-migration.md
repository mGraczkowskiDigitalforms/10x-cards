# React 19 Migration Specification

This document outlines the necessary changes to migrate the project components in the `src` folder to React 19 in accordance with the official React 19 upgrade guide and available codemods.

## 1. Entry Point Components
- Update any usage of `ReactDOM.render` or `ReactDOM.hydrate` to use `createRoot` or `hydrateRoot` respectively.
- Identify and update components or pages in `src/pages` or any other client-side entry points.

## 2. String Refs
- Replace string refs (e.g., `ref="myRef"`) with callback refs or use `React.createRef` to ensure compatibility with React 19.

## 3. React.createFactory and Module Pattern Factories
- Refactor any usage of `React.createFactory` to use JSX syntax for component creation.
- Update any module pattern factories to standard functional components.

## 4. Unmounting Components
- Replace usage of `ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode` with the `unmount()` method on the root created by `createRoot` or `hydrateRoot`.

## Search Recommendations
- Perform a search for `ReactDOM.render`, `ReactDOM.hydrate`, `ref="`, and `React.createFactory` within the `src` folder to identify all affected files.
- Focus particularly on components involved in application initialization and client-side rendering.

## Additional Notes
- Test the application thoroughly after applying these changes to ensure stability.
- Utilize provided codemods where appropriate to automate parts of the migration process.
