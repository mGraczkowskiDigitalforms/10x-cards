## Project Scope

This project focuses on improving flashcard-based learning through intelligent automation.

### ✅ Included in MVP

- AI-driven flashcard generation from pasted text
- Manual creation, editing, and deletion of flashcards
- Simple user account system to persist data
- Integration with an existing spaced repetition algorithm

### ❌ Out of Scope for MVP

- Custom or advanced spaced repetition algorithms (e.g. SuperMemo, Anki)
- Importing from file formats like PDF or DOCX
- Sharing decks with other users
- Third-party integrations with educational platforms
- Mobile applications (initially web-only)

### ✅ Success Criteria

- **75%** of flashcards generated by AI are accepted by users
- **75%** of all created flashcards use the AI generation feature

## Project Status

- **Version:** `0.0.1`
- **Stage:** Early Development (MVP)

Development is ongoing. Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are welcome!

## Testing

The project uses a comprehensive testing strategy that includes both unit and E2E tests. Tests are organized in the following structure:

```
tests/
  ├── unit/              # Unit and component tests
  │   └── *.test.tsx    # Unit test files
  ├── e2e/              # End-to-end tests
  │   ├── page-objects/ # Page Object Models
  │   │   ├── base.page.ts
  │   │   ├── home.page.ts
  │   │   └── counter.page.ts
  │   └── specs/        # Test specifications
  │       ├── home.spec.ts
  │       └── counter.spec.ts
  └── setup/            # Test configuration
      └── setup.ts      # Setup file for unit tests
```

### Unit Testing (Vitest)

Unit tests are written using Vitest and React Testing Library. They focus on testing individual components and functions in isolation.

```bash
# Run unit tests in watch mode
npm test

# Run unit tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### E2E Testing (Playwright)

E2E tests use Playwright with Page Object Model pattern. They test the application from a user's perspective in a real browser environment.

Available commands:

```bash
# List all available tests
npx playwright test --list

# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run tests in debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test home.spec.ts

# Run tests matching specific title
npx playwright test -g "should increment count"

# Run tests in specific group
npx playwright test -g "accessibility"
```

### Test Reports

Test results and artifacts are stored in the following locations:
- Unit test reports: `test-reports/unit/`
- E2E test reports: `test-reports/e2e/`
- Coverage reports: `coverage/`
- Playwright reports: `playwright-report/`

To view test reports:
```bash
# For unit test reports
npx vite preview --outDir test-reports/unit

# For E2E test reports
npx playwright show-report playwright-report
```

### Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run in GitHub Actions on:
- Push to main branch
- Pull requests to main branch

CI pipeline includes:
- Unit tests with coverage reporting
- E2E tests in Chromium
- ESLint checks
- TypeScript type checking
- Coverage reports upload to Codecov

Test artifacts and reports are automatically uploaded and available in GitHub Actions.

### Writing Tests

#### Unit Tests
- Use `describe` for test grouping
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and error cases

Example:
```typescript
describe('Component', () => {
  it('should handle specific case', () => {
    // Arrange
    render(<Component />);
    
    // Act
    userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button'));
    
    // Assert
    expect(screen.getByText('Result')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

#### E2E Tests
- Use Page Object Model for maintainability
- Test user workflows
- Include accessibility checks
- Add visual regression tests when needed

Example:
```typescript
test.describe('Feature', () => {
  test('should complete user flow', async ({ page }) => {
    const pageObject = new PageObject(page);
    await pageObject.goto();
    await pageObject.performAction();
    await pageObject.expectResult();
  });
});
```
