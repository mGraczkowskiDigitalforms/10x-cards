## Project Description

10x-cards is a web application designed to streamline the creation of educational flashcards for spaced repetition learning.  
- Generating flashcards using AI based on user-provided text.
- Allowing for manual flashcard creation.
- Enabling the review, editing, and deletion of flashcards.
- Providing a simple user account system to store and manage flashcards.
- Integrating with a pre-existing spaced repetition algorithm to optimize learning.

## Project Scope

This project focuses on improving flashcard-based learning through intelligent automation.

### ✅ Included in MVP

- AI-driven flashcard generation from pasted text
- Manual creation, editing, and deletion of flashcards
- Simple user account system to persist data
- Integration with an existing spaced repetition algorithm

### ❌ Out of Scope for MVP

- Custom or advanced spaced repetition algorithms (e.g. SuperMemo, Anki)
- Importing from file formats like PDF or DOCX
- Sharing decks with other users
- Third-party integrations with educational platforms
- Mobile applications (initially web-only)

### ✅ Success Criteria

- **75%** of flashcards generated by AI are accepted by users
- **75%** of all created flashcards use the AI generation feature

## Project Status

- **Version:** `0.0.1`
- **Stage:** Early Development (MVP)

Development is ongoing. Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are welcome!

## Testing

The project uses a comprehensive testing strategy that includes both unit and E2E tests. Tests are organized in the `tests` directory with the following structure:

```
tests/
  ├── unit/              # Unit and component tests
  ├── e2e/               # End-to-end tests
  └── setup/             # Test configuration files
```

### Unit Testing

We use Vitest as our unit testing framework along with React Testing Library for component testing. Mock Service Worker (MSW) is used for API mocking.

Key features:
- Fast test execution with watch mode
- Interactive UI for test debugging
- Code coverage reporting with v8 provider
- API mocking with MSW
- DOM testing with jsdom
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- HTML test reports generation

Testing guidelines:
- Use `describe` blocks to group related tests
- Write descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Use `data-testid` attributes for test-specific element selection
- Mock external dependencies and complex calculations
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Keep tests focused and isolated

Run unit tests:
```sh
npm test              # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:ui       # Run tests with UI
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report
```

View test reports:
```sh
npx vite preview --outDir test-reports/unit
```

### E2E Testing

End-to-end testing is handled by Playwright, focusing on Chrome/Chromium for desktop testing.

Key features:
- Automatic screenshot on test failure
- Video recording of failed tests
- Trace viewer for debugging
- Interactive UI for test debugging
- Parallel test execution
- CI/CD integration ready
- HTML test reports

Testing guidelines:
- Use Page Object Model for maintainable tests
- Leverage Playwright's built-in locators
- Implement proper test isolation
- Use test hooks for setup and teardown
- Add visual regression tests when needed
- Keep tests focused on user workflows

Run E2E tests:
```sh
npm run test:e2e       # Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e:ui    # Run tests with UI
npm run test:e2e:debug # Run tests in debug mode
```

### Example Component and Test

The project includes an example component (`ExampleComponent.tsx`) and its corresponding test (`tests/unit/ExampleComponent.test.tsx`) that demonstrates:
- Component testing setup
- Event handling testing
- Props and state testing
- Callback testing
- Test organization
- Best practices for component and test structure

Review these files to understand our testing patterns and conventions.
