## Project Description

10x-cards is a web application designed to streamline the creation of educational flashcards for spaced repetition learning.  
- Generating flashcards using AI based on user-provided text.
- Allowing for manual flashcard creation.
- Enabling the review, editing, and deletion of flashcards.
- Providing a simple user account system to store and manage flashcards.
- Integrating with a pre-existing spaced repetition algorithm to optimize learning.

## Tech Stack

The project utilizes a modern technology stack to ensure efficiency and maintainability:

- **Framework:** Astro
- **Frontend Library:** React
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS
- **UI Components & Icons:** Radix UI, Lucide React
- **Utility Libraries:** clsx, class-variance-authority, tailwind-merge, tw-animate-css
- **Testing:**
  - **Unit Testing:** Vitest, React Testing Library, MSW (Mock Service Worker)
  - **E2E Testing:** Playwright
- **Tooling:** ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript

## Project Scope

This project focuses on improving flashcard-based learning through intelligent automation.

### ✅ Included in MVP

- AI-driven flashcard generation from pasted text
- Manual creation, editing, and deletion of flashcards
- Simple user account system to persist data
- Integration with an existing spaced repetition algorithm

### ❌ Out of Scope for MVP

- Custom or advanced spaced repetition algorithms (e.g. SuperMemo, Anki)
- Importing from file formats like PDF or DOCX
- Sharing decks with other users
- Third-party integrations with educational platforms
- Mobile applications (initially web-only)

### ✅ Success Criteria

- **75%** of flashcards generated by AI are accepted by users
- **75%** of all created flashcards use the AI generation feature

## Project Status

- **Version:** `0.0.1`
- **Stage:** Early Development (MVP)

Development is ongoing. Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are welcome!

## Testing

The project uses a comprehensive testing strategy that includes both unit and E2E tests.

### Unit Testing

We use Vitest as our unit testing framework along with React Testing Library for component testing. Mock Service Worker (MSW) is used for API mocking.

Key features:
- Fast test execution with watch mode
- Interactive UI for test debugging
- Code coverage reporting
- API mocking with MSW
- DOM testing with jsdom
- Component testing with React Testing Library

Run unit tests:
```sh
npm test              # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:ui       # Run tests with UI
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report
```

### E2E Testing

End-to-end testing is handled by Playwright, focusing on Chrome/Chromium for desktop testing.

Key features:
- Automatic screenshot on test failure
- Video recording of failed tests
- Trace viewer for debugging
- Interactive UI for test debugging
- Parallel test execution
- CI/CD integration ready

Run E2E tests:
```sh
npm run test:e2e       # Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e:ui    # Run tests with UI
npm run test:e2e:debug # Run tests in debug mode
```
