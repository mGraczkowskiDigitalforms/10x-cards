## Project Description

10x-cards is a web application designed to streamline the creation of educational flashcards for spaced repetition learning.  
- Generating flashcards using AI based on user-provided text.
- Allowing for manual flashcard creation.
- Enabling the review, editing, and deletion of flashcards.
- Providing a simple user account system to store and manage flashcards.
- Integrating with a pre-existing spaced repetition algorithm to optimize learning.

## Project Scope

This project focuses on improving flashcard-based learning through intelligent automation.

### ✅ Included in MVP

- AI-driven flashcard generation from pasted text
- Manual creation, editing, and deletion of flashcards
- Simple user account system to persist data
- Integration with an existing spaced repetition algorithm

### ❌ Out of Scope for MVP

- Custom or advanced spaced repetition algorithms (e.g. SuperMemo, Anki)
- Importing from file formats like PDF or DOCX
- Sharing decks with other users
- Third-party integrations with educational platforms
- Mobile applications (initially web-only)

### ✅ Success Criteria

- **75%** of flashcards generated by AI are accepted by users
- **75%** of all created flashcards use the AI generation feature

## Project Status
